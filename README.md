# Student-Reporting-System
Report the data of student to the user

In this program we can add a student with some information like name and marks of some subjects like maths, science and english.

after adding the students we can see the report of students 
1) percentage report of class
2) Average marks of each student
3) Top student from class
 
I have used the Java language to make this project,
 I used the linked list data structure to store the data of students.
